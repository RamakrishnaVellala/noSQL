# **noSQL Databases**


first of all, we discuss the purpose of writing this technical paper is that how we can improve performance and scallability using NoSQL databases

MySQL is a widely used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) and is an excellent solution for many applications, including web-scale applications. However, its architecture has limitations when it comes to big data analytics.

In RDBMS, it is restricted to  rigid schema. Now a days in Distributed systems with big data, many scalability and performance issues faced by RDBMS

for these issues NoSQL (not only SQL ) came to existence NoSQL is achieving greater and greater popularity with every passing year, its most significant implementations being such products as Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, and others.

It has been primarily developed to address the scalability problem characteristic of SQL. As a result, it is schema-free and built on distributed systems, which makes it easy to scale and shard.

NoSQL database options include:

    1.MongoDB – by far the most popular NoSQL database
    2.Redis – an open source, distributed, in-memory key-value database that is super fast
    3.Cassandra – free, open-source NoSQL database created by Facebook that focuses on scalability and high availability


Cloud service providers offer plenty of NoSQL options as well:

    1.AWS has:
        DynamoDB, its managed NoSQL database
        DocumentDB, a fast, scalable, highly-available MongoDB-compatible database
    2.Microsoft Azure offers:
        CosmosDB, its globally distributed, multi-model database
    3.Google Cloud has:
        Bigtable, its NoSQL wide-column database service
        Cloud Datastore, its NoSQL document database service
        Cloud Firestore, a cloud-native NoSQL document database that helps store and query app data

one conclusion is that NoSQL Databases showed  solution for performance and scalability issue arrised by digital world
